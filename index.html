          <p class='description'>“Just be true to yourself, and listen as much as one is able to other people whose opinions you respect and look up to but in the end,
             it has to come from you. 
             You can’t really worry too much by looking to the left and the right about what the competition is doing or what other people in your field are doing.
              It has to be a true vision.” – Anna Wintour </p>

             Whereas building something slowly and carefully that has value and quality, 
             that’s what’s going to have legs.” – Anna Wintour </p>

            Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only.
             Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, 
             the way we live, what is happening.” -Coco Chanel

          <p class='description'> One tradition I have with my friends is that when one of us gets married, 
            we have a ton of fragrance oils and pretty bottles at the bachelorette party.
             Everyone puts a drop or two in a bottle for the bride and makes a wish, 
             and the bride wears our creation on her wedding day.
